# Low-Latency-Applications-Book-Learning

This code is taken originally from the Building Low Latency Application with C++ book material. 
Github repo: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Low-Latency-Applications-with-CPP.git

I use the current repo to learn, experiment, enhance and possibly write some modules of a Low Latency Application for Trading. All with the aim to better understand low latency systems and low level coding in C++.
